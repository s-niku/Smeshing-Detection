Perfect 👍 a **good README** is like the front page of your project — it tells anyone how to use it.

Since your project is a **Python + FastAPI smishing detection API**, I’ll give you a complete `README.md` structure you can copy-paste and edit.

# 📱 Smishing Detection

A Machine Learning + FastAPI project that detects smishing (SMS phishing) messages.  
This project uses an ML model trained on SMS data and provides an API endpoint to classify messages as **Spam** or **Ham**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Trained ML model (`model.pkl`) with vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`)
- FastAPI REST API for prediction
- Simple usage with `curl` or Postman
- Easy to extend with new data

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-niku/Smeshing-Detection.git
cd Smeshing-Detection
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the environment

* On **Windows (PowerShell)**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* On **Linux / Mac**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the API

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn src.serve_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Now the API is live at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 📡 How to Use

### 1. Test with `curl`

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Your account is locked. Click here to unlock"}'
```

### 2. Test with Postman

* Method: **POST**
* URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict`
* Body (raw, JSON):

```json
{
  "text": "Congratulations! You won a free lottery. Claim now."
}
```

### 3. Expected Response

```json
{
  "prediction": "spam"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "prediction": "ham"
}
```

⚡ Notes:
- You should create a `requirements.txt` file (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`) before pushing again.  
- If you want, I can generate a **`.gitignore`** too so `venv/` and datasets don’t clutter GitHub.  

👉 Do you want me to **write you the exact `requirements.txt`** for your project (based on FastAPI + scikit-learn + uvicorn)?
